            <h1>ADITYA ENGINEERING COLLEGE AT A GLANCE</h1>

            <p>
              Aditya Engineering College came into existence on the 15th day of
              November, 2006. It was an upgradation of Aditya College established in
              1868, one of the oldest and largest colleges in India which
              subsequently became an autonomous college with CPE status by UGC and
              'A' grade by NAAC. The College with all its glorious academic
              achievement and ceaseless scholastic pursuits had already created a
              distinct niche for itself in India and beyond. The history of this
              great institution is, in a manner of speaking, the history of modern
              Orissa. It was the cradle of ideas fostering national unity and
              nationalism, promoting social mobilization and gearing up the freedom
              struggle.The grand hall of this institution was a theatre of history:
              on the 1st of April'1936 it was the venue for the declaration of
              Orissa as a separate province; thereafter it housed the state's first
              legislative assembly up to and even after Independence till it was
              shifted to Bhubaneswar, the new capital of the state. During Quit
              India Movement of 1942 the students of this institution brought down
              the Union Jack as a mark of nationalistic fervour.<br />
